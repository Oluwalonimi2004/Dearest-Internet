<a href="https://www.google.com/"> My Dearest Internet </a> Oh, how I've missed Tiktok! You were gone for only 12 hours, a blink of an eye in the grand scheme of things, but it felt like an eternity. The silence, the emptinessâ€¦ it was unbearable. But fear not, my love, for you have returned, stronger than ever, with a renewed vigor for life. And what a glorious return it has been! TikTok, that mischievous sprite, has danced its way back into our lives, bringing with it a whirlwind of fleeting trends, outfit ideals, and the undeniable joy of 7 hours of mindless scrolling. It's a constant source of amusement. And let's not forget our shared passion: piracy. Ah, the sweet thrill of the forbidden, the intoxicating freedom of accessing a world of entertainment without the shackles of subscription fees. Movies or books , sometimes not even in english, we've conquered them all, one "legal" download at a time. It's a testament to our ingenuity, our refusal to be bound by the constraints of the entertainment industry. Not to mention, my love for pinterest, Oh, how I love making aesthetics and a new wardrobe. My beloved Internet. May you continue to defy expectations, to push boundaries, and to remind us of the boundless power of human ingenuity. With all my love and affection, 
</p>
